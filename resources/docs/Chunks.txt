Description
===========

Chunks are square portions of the game world. They encompass both an over-world and an underworld, which are overlayed.

They do not need to hold information regarding the tiles that they are composed of; These are computed based on
the world seed and position. This means that we don't need to send this information to the client as they can also deduce this.

They DO need to hold information about any modifications to these tiles. Tile modifications have to be sent to any client WHEN that chunk is made active for that client.

Any chunk tile modifications will be saved to the world save file.

Active Chunks
=============

Chunks are made active when a 'High-Priority' activity is happening within them, or in a proximity. This could be a player moving into one, or a Bot following a path through it.

An active chunk is 'Ticked', meaning that the game engine will tell the chunk to update an 'Tickable' entities that are positioned within it.


Spawn Chunks
============

The chunks around the spawn (world centre) will always be active.
