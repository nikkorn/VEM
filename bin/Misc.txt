Players are characters who have left their underground dwelling to start a farm on the overworld.

Ideas:
  - Can craft items from your inventory.
  - Players can pick a new spawn point on the map.
  - player inventories show as a vertical bar on the screen.
  - Merchants can spawn in random spots on the map and sell resources.
  - Wood is obtained by finding wood that tree placements drop.
  - Boats allow the player to walk over water as long as a crafted boat is in their inventory?
  - Bots can be made and placed on rails to automate watering? seeding? animal control?
  - Rarer crops/resources on a farm will prompt animal spawns to destroy the farm to get to them.
